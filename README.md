5D Cistercian Lattice/Decrypt function/ Symbols, Colours, Shades, Complexity/1114111

The LatticeSymbol struct represents a symbol in the lattice and contains the following members:

symbol: An unsigned integer representing the symbol itself.
colors: A vector of strings representing the colors associated with the symbol.
shades: A vector of strings representing the shades associated with the symbol.
complexity: A std::bitset<512> representing the complexity of the symbol.
The createLattice function generates a lattice based on the provided dimensions (width, height, depth, time, dimension5). It uses random values to populate the lattice symbols with random symbol, colors, shades, and complexity values. The lattice is a five-dimensional vector structure.

The generateRandomUnicodeString function generates a random Unicode string of the specified length.

The encryptMessage function takes a message, lattice, encryption key, and the number of encryption rounds as input. It iterates over each character in the message and performs encryption operations. It selects a lattice symbol based on the character's indices in the lattice and determines the maximum complexity symbol within the lattice. It then performs XOR operations between the character, the encryption key, and the selected lattice symbol to obtain the encrypted character. The encrypted characters are collected and returned as a string.

The decryptMessage function takes an encrypted message, lattice, encryption key, and the number of decryption rounds as input. It iterates over each character in the encrypted message and performs decryption operations. It selects a lattice symbol based on the character's indices in the lattice and determines the maximum complexity symbol within the lattice. It then performs XOR operations between the encrypted character, the encryption key, and the selected lattice symbol to obtain the decrypted character. The decrypted characters are collected and returned as a string.

In the main function:

The lattice is created using the createLattice function with specified dimensions.
A message is defined.
An encryption key is generated using the generateRandomUnicodeString function.
The number of encryption rounds is specified.
The original message, encryption key, encrypted message, and decrypted message are displayed.
